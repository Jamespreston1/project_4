          <h2><em>What is an ETF?</em></h2>
          <p>Good question! An ETF is an investment that's like a basket filled with different kinds of fruits (but instead of fruit they may be stocks, bonds, etc.). 
          Instead of buying each fruit separately, you can buy a share of the basket, and you'll own a small part of all the fruits inside.</p>
  
          <h2><em>How is that different to a stock?</em></h2>
          <p>A "stock" (aka a "Common Stock") is like buying one specific fruit from the basket. You own that particular piece, and your investment is tied to how well that specific fruit is doing.</p>
          <h2>Okay, so why should I invest in ETF's all of a sudden?</h2>
          <p> Its all about "Passive Investment"! Lets break that down.</p>
          <ol>
      <li><strong>Why Everyone's Talking About ETFs:</strong></li>
      <p>So, there's a lot of buzz about these things called ETFs, especially among everyday folks like us. Let's break down what's making them so popular:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Easy on the Wallet:</strong> ETFs tend to have lower fees than those fancy managed funds. Less cost = more money for us!</li>

          <li><strong>No Secrets:</strong> ETFs tell you what they're invested in every day. No shady business here!</li>
          <li><strong>Buy and Sell Anytime:</strong> Just like stocks, you can trade ETFs whenever the stock market's open. Talk about flexibility!</li>
          <li><strong>Less Tax Hassle:</strong> Thanks to how they're set up, ETFs can help you dodge some pesky tax events.</li>

          <h2><em>Terminology</em></h2>
  
          <strong><em>Total Assets</em></strong>
          <p>Total Assets in an ETF refers to the total market value of all the assets held by that ETF. It's essentially a measurement of the size or scale of the ETF.</p>
  
          <strong><em> Tracking Error</em></strong>
          <p>It's the difference between the performance of the ETF and the performance of the index it's trying to mimic.</p>
  
          <strong><em>Total Return 1YR (1 Year)</em></strong>
          <p>You buy a magic bean plant (an ETF) for $100. After a year, the plant grows and is now worth $110. Also, during that year, it produced beans (like dividends) worth $10. So, your total return for 1 year would be 20% (($110 + $10 - $100) / $100).</p>
  
          <strong><em>Total Return 3Yr (3 Years)</em></strong>
          <p>The same principle for Total Return 1Yr! Just instead over a 3 year period.</p>
